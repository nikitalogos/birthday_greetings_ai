Create outstanding birthday greetings for your loved ones, friends and colleagues! 
Use them right away, or take them as templates to spark your own creativity. 
Welcome to the ~~future~~ present! Your birthday present! üéÅ

## How to use

1. Navigate to https://logosnikita.com/birthday_greetings_ai/
2. Obtain a token from [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) and paste it into the corresponding field
   1. You can skip this step and copy prompt for your favourite chatbot
3. Click "Next" to get to "Params" tab
4. Fill in data about a person you want to congratulate.
   1. You can just enter name and that will be enough, but to get more personalized greeting you may want to fill in other fields
   2. Params you enter will result in a prompt for AI model. You can see it below the input form.
5. Press "Create greeting" to generate a greeting with Llama 2.
   1. You will get to "AI Response" tab. Please wait until AI creates a response.
   2. You can copy response to clipboard, regenerate response or export the entire dialogue as .txt or .json
6. On "Params" page you can either copy prompt to clipboard to paste it into a different chatbot.
   1. For example: [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Claude 2](https://chat.claudeai.ai)

## Example results

Although this app uses Llama 2 as a language model, you can achive better results 
in bigger, but yet less accessible :( models.

For example, here's what I've managed to generate in OpenAI's GPT-4:
1. [Samurai Tiger's Birthday üêØüéÇ (verbose)](https://chat.openai.com/share/5f85c7ef-d6db-4cf8-bde3-753f82439688)
2. [Tiger's Samurai Birthday üêØüéÇ‚öîÔ∏è (laconic)](https://chat.openai.com/share/bf914614-0502-4c43-a8f6-88dd41da4713)

## Integrations

Birthday Greetings AI supports passing `name` and `date_of_birth` params in url query:
```
https://logosnikita.com/birthday_greetings_ai/?name=Victor&date_of_birth=1998-04-21
```
1. Spaces (and other special characters) in `name` should be encoded to be a valid URL: 
   - `Victor Frankenstein` ‚Üí `Victor%20Frankenstein`
2. `date_of_birth` should be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

### Example integration

My another project, [Birthday Reminder](https://github.com/nikitalogos/birthday_reminder) has integration with `Birthday Greetings AI`.

It creates birthday events in Google Calendar and 
adds a link to this app with pre-computed `name` and `date_of_birth` fields into the event description,
so you can just click it from calendar or from email notification.
